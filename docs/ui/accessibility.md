# accessibility

**Status:** IMPLEMENTED (targeted audit — UI-038)  
**Component ID:** UI-038  
**Master plan:** [flash-premium-chat-ui-implementation.md](flash-premium-chat-ui-implementation.md)  
**Template:** [component-doc-template.md](component-doc-template.md)  
**Depends on:** UI-037 (`FlashMotion` reduce-motion contract), UI-005/UI-011/UI-018/UI-019 components

---

## Component

Accessibility layer across chat composables: semantics coverage (content/state
descriptions, roles, live regions), touch-target compliance, color-independence of
meaning, and the reduce-motion contract. Haptic accessibility is documented in
[motion-system.md §UI-039](motion-system.md) and implemented in
`ui/theme/.../FlashFeedback.kt`.

## Purpose

Guarantee that Flash's P2P messaging UI is usable with TalkBack, large fonts,
switch access, and reduced-motion settings — without restructuring layouts or
compromising the custom (non-Material) visual identity.

## Research sources

| Source | What was studied |
|---|---|
| [Compose Accessibility — Semantics](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/accessibility/semantics) | `contentDescription`, `stateDescription`, `Role`, `liveRegion` (`Polite` default; avoid on frequently-updating content like countdown timers); merging/clearing strategies |
| [Compose Accessibility — API defaults](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/accessibility/api-defaults) | 48dp minimum touch targets; Compose automatically expands clickable targets below 48dp outside visual bounds; decorative icons use `contentDescription = null`; unique per-item descriptions in lists |
| [Make apps more accessible](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/accessibility/apps) | Descriptions convey purpose not visuals; avoid "Submit button"-style redundancy; 48×48dp ≈ 9mm target guidance |
| [Accessibility codelab](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/jetpack-compose-accessibility) | Touch-target expansion patterns; `clearAndSetSemantics` + custom actions; `stateDescription` for toggleable rows |
| [Touch target size — Google Support](https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/7101858) | 8dp separation between targets; targets extend beyond visual bounds |
| [Android reduced motion — `AccessibilityManager`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/accessibility/AccessibilityManager#isReduceMotionEnabled()) | API 33+ `isReduceMotionEnabled()`; legacy `ANIMATOR_DURATION_SCALE == 0` heuristic |

No proprietary code was copied; fixes below are mechanical semantics additions.

## Existing approaches studied

### A — Full rescreen with Material components for built-in a11y

**Verdict:** Rejected — violates AGENTS.md §34 prohibition on Material-template chat UI;
Flash's custom chrome already carries most needed semantics manually.

### B — Targeted semantics audit + mechanical fixes on existing composables (chosen)

**Pros:** Small diffs, no layout restructure, directly addresses real gaps found.  
**Cons:** Requires re-audit when new components land (checklist below mitigates).

## What worked

- `FlashMotion`'s centralized `reduceMotion` flag: every animation already branches on it;
  no component-level work was needed for motion reduction (see contract summary below).
- Components designed post-UI-001 (search bar, voice card, file card) already shipped
  `contentDescription`, `stateDescription`, roles, and live regions — the audit found the
  gaps concentrated in older chrome.

## What did not work

- Relying on merged text alone for bubbles: selection/search highlight is drawn via
  border + accent tint (color-only) and was invisible to TalkBack → fixed with
  `stateDescription`.
- Assuming small clickables are inaccessible without layout change: Compose expands
  touch targets beyond bounds by default, so sub-48dp *visual* sizes are acceptable
  where expansion does not overlap neighbors (documented per finding below).

## Chosen approach

Targeted audit of the six conversation-critical composables
(`FlashMessageBubble`, `FlashMessageList`, `FlashComposer`, `FlashChatHeader`,
`FlashVoiceMessageCard`, `FlashMediaViewer`) against four checks:
missing content/state descriptions, touch targets < 48dp, color-only meaning, missing
live regions on dynamic counters. Fix mechanically in place; log every finding.

## Why it was chosen

Scope discipline (AGENTS.md §34 research-first, minimal mechanical edits) plus the fact
that Flash's token system already centralizes motion; only semantic glue was missing.

## Visual specification

N/A — accessibility fixes add no visuals. Selection highlight remains accent border +
tint but is now also announced as state.

## Interaction specification

- All interactive elements expose `Role.Button` (or inherit from `clickable`).
- Dynamic counters announce via `LiveRegionMode.Polite` (never Assertive; never on
  high-frequency tickers such as recording timers or waveform scrubbing).

## Animation specification

Covered entirely by the **reduce-motion contract** in `ui/theme/.../FlashMotion.kt`
(UI-037), which this component consumes and documents:

- `FlashMotion.isReduceMotionEnabled(context)` detects API 33+
  `AccessibilityManager.isReduceMotionEnabled` **or** `ANIMATOR_DURATION_SCALE == 0`.
- `rememberFlashMotion()` exposes one `reduceMotion` flag; all named transitions
  (`messageEnter`, `statusCrossfade`, `screenTransition`, …) collapse to instant swaps /
  zero-duration specs when set.
- Component rule: press scales, pulses, staggered entrances, and swipe springs all gate
  on `!motion.reduceMotion` (verified during this audit in bubbles, attachment button/
  sheet/tiles, voice badge/card/mic, quick reactions, send button, search chrome).
- Presence/delivery/encryption state is never conveyed by animation alone — each has a
  textual description or label (delivery icon a11y strings, header status text).

## Gesture specification

Swipe-to-reply threshold haptic + reveal are supplemented by the bubble's long-press
menu, so gesture-only functionality has an accessible alternative. Media viewer gestures
(pinch zoom, dismiss drag) have chrome-button equivalents (close/save/share).

## Accessibility requirements

See findings table + checklist below. Ongoing rule for new components:
every interactive element needs role + description (or inherited behavior),
dynamic counters need polite live regions, state must be describable without color.

## Responsive behavior

Not affected. Large-font check deferred to device QA (checklist).

## Dark-mode behavior

Not affected — descriptions are theme-independent; contrast validated in UI-001 palettes.

## Performance considerations

Live regions must not be attached to frequently-updating nodes (per Android guidance):
recording timer and voice elapsed labels deliberately have none; counters (search
results, page index, unseen pill) change rarely enough for Polite announcements.
`graphicsLayer` press-scale animations remain GPU-composited under reduce-motion gating.

## Implementation notes

### Audit table (component / issue / severity / fix)

| # | Component | Issue | Severity | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `FlashMessageBubble.kt` | Selected/search-highlighted state conveyed only by border + tint (color-only meaning); TalkBack silent | High | Added `stateDescription = "Selected"` inside bubble's merged semantics when `isSelected \|\| isHighlighted` |
| 2 | `FlashChatHeader.kt` | Avatar/group-collage clickables had no role/contentDescription (opens conversation info) | Medium | Added `role = Role.Button` + `contentDescription = "View conversation info"` to both avatar branches |
| 3 | `FlashChatHeader.kt` | `FlashHeaderIconButton` had contentDescription but no `Role.Button` | Low | Added `role = Role.Button` |
| 4 | `FlashMediaViewer.kt` | Page counter ("3 / 7") changes on swipe with no live region | Medium | Added `liveRegion = LiveRegionMode.Polite` to counter text |
| 5 | `FlashMediaViewer.kt` | Chrome icon buttons lacked explicit `Role.Button` | Low | Added `role = Role.Button` to `FlashIconButtonChrome` (descriptions already present) |
| 6 | `FlashMessageList.kt` | "N new messages" pill counter updates while visible without announcement | Medium | Added `liveRegion = LiveRegionMode.Polite` to pill semantics |
| 7 | `FlashReactionChip.kt` (audit-only) | Visual min size 36×28dp < 48dp | Info / accepted | No change: Compose expands clickable touch target beyond bounds (API-defaults doc); chips are ≥ space4 apart; layout restructure prohibited |
| 8 | `FlashMessageContextMenu.kt` quick reactions (audit-only) | 32dp buttons, expanded targets may slightly overlap in dense row | Info / accepted | Same rationale as #7; long spacing is space4; menu is transient overlay |
| 9 | `FlashComposer.kt` reply-dock dismiss (audit-only) | M3 `IconButton` sized 24dp visually | Info / accepted | M3 IconButton enforces 48dp minimum interactive size internally; contentDescription present |
| 10 | `FlashDeliveryStatusIcon.kt` retry (audit-only) | 14dp clickable icon in timestamp row | Info / accepted | Touch target auto-expanded; row height constrains overlap risk; description already announces "Double-tap to retry" |
| 11 | `FlashComposer.kt` input pill (audit-only) | Placeholder is separate `Text`, announced when empty | OK | No fix needed; field exposes editable-text semantics natively |
| 12 | `FlashVoiceMessageCard.kt` (audit-only) | Waveform played/unplayed coloring is color-only | Info / accepted | Redundant cues exist: duration/remaining label + card `stateDescription` ("Playing"/"Paused"); Canvas seek is supplementary |

### Reduce-motion contract

Single source of truth: `FlashTheme.motion.reduceMotion` from
`ui/theme/src/main/java/com/transfer/flash/ui/theme/FlashMotion.kt`. Detection, token
zeroing, and transition collapsing live there — see §Animation specification above and
[motion-system.md](motion-system.md) (UI-037). Haptics are intentionally NOT muted by
reduce-motion (non-visual channel); policy lives in `FlashHapticPolicy.enabled()`
([motion-system.md §UI-039](motion-system.md)).

## Testing checklist

- [x] Semantics additions compile-clean within existing modifier chains (no Gradle run permitted this session — build verification deferred to next session)
- [ ] TalkBack pass: bubble selection announcement, header avatar, media-viewer counter, new-messages pill (physical device)
- [ ] TalkBack pass: send/retry/attachment flows announce actions before motion completes
- [ ] Large font (200%): composer row, reaction chips, voice pill do not truncate actionability
- [ ] Display size largest: 48dp-equivalent targets still reachable without mis-taps
- [ ] Reduce-motion ON: all screens swap instantly; haptics still play (by design)
- [ ] Dark mode: no contrast regressions from untouched colors
- [ ] RTL: mirrored layouts keep live regions and roles intact (deferred with UI-033)

## Known limitations

- Sub-48dp visual controls rely on Compose's automatic touch-target expansion; where
  expanded targets sit close (quick reactions, delivery retry), overlap is possible on
  dense layouts — flagged for UI-043 stress test rather than fixed now (layout freeze).
- Hard-coded English description strings throughout (no string resources yet);
  localization is tracked at project level, not per-component.
- Search-result highlighting remains color-only inside message text (AnnotatedString
  background span); TalkBack reads the sentence without marking matches — acceptable
  because the result stepper announces position ("3 / 7").
- Recording timer intentionally has no live region (high-frequency updates would spam
  TalkBack); phase transitions could gain custom accessibility events later.

## Future improvements

- Custom accessibility actions on bubbles (react / reply / copy) instead of relying on
  long-press equivalence.
- `paneTitle` / traversal-order review for the focus overlay (UI-007).
- Automated semantics assertions via Compose UI tests once instrumentation infra exists.
- Re-run this audit for every new component (UI-011+ sequence) before its IMPLEMENTED mark.

## What makes this Flash?

Accessibility here is quiet infrastructure, matching the app's calm-premium character:
instant feedback for users who remove animations, spoken state instead of color-only
accents, and haptics kept as a first-class non-visual channel — without ever letting an
a11y template dictate the visual identity.
