## Component

`FlashMediaViewer` — full-screen immersive photo viewer overlay opened from `FlashImageGrid` tiles, with a `FlashMediaPage` zoomable page inside a `HorizontalPager` album carousel, chrome (top counter bar + bottom action bar), and vertical swipe-to-dismiss.

## Purpose

Tapping a photo tile in a conversation must open the image full-screen so users can inspect detail: pinch/double-tap zoom, pan while zoomed, swipe through the album, save/share/forward the photo, and dismiss by swiping down or Back. This is the "open → inspect → return" loop required by every premium messenger; without it the UI-017 grid is a dead end.

Appears in: `FlashConversationScreen` (opened from `FlashImageGrid.onImageClick` in `FlashMessageBubble`).

## Research sources

- Android Developers — Compose gestures: `detectTransformGestures`, `detectTapGestures`, low-level `awaitEachGesture` / `awaitPointerEventScope` (official gesture & pointer-input documentation).
- Jetpack Compose documentation — `androidx.compose.foundation.pager` (`HorizontalPager`, `PagerState`, `rememberPagerState`, `beyondViewportPageCount`), stable since Compose Foundation 1.4.x; still stable in the version resolved by this project (Foundation **1.10.0** via `compose-bom = 2025.12.00` — verified by inspecting `foundation-android-1.10.0.aar` classes: `androidx.compose.foundation.pager.*` present; `androidx.compose.foundation.gestures.zoomable.*` **absent** from this release).
- Android Developers — shared element transitions (`Modifier.sharedElement`, `SharedTransitionScope` — `@ExperimentalSharedTransitionApi` in the current release).
- Reference app behavior (interaction patterns only, no code copied): Telegram (full-screen pager + swipe-down dismiss + chrome auto-hide), WhatsApp (drag-to-dismiss with scaling + dim animation, counter `3/7`), Signal (pager + back/save chrome), Google Photos (claim-policy model: zoomed pan owns gestures, un-zoomed vertical drag dismisses, un-zoomed horizontal drag pages).

## Existing approaches studied

### Approach A — Stable Foundation pager + custom pointer-input zoom state (selected)

`HorizontalPager` (stable API) hosts one `FlashMediaPage` per photo. Each page owns a small state holder (`FlashZoomState`: `Animatable` scale + `Animatable` offset) driven by one custom `awaitEachGesture` pointer-input with an explicit gesture **claim policy** (section "Gesture specification"). Dismiss is the same claim policy on the un-zoomed vertical axis. Chrome toggles via `detectTapGestures` single/double-tap. Open/close uses the existing reserved `FlashMotion.mediaOpenEnter()` / `mediaOpenExit()` tokens.

### Approach B — `androidx.compose.foundation.gestures.zoomable` (`ZoomableState`)

Compose Foundation publishes a first-party `ZoomableState`/`Modifier.zoomable` in **alpha** channels only. Verified against the artifact actually resolved by this project (`foundation-android-1.10.0`): the `zoomable` package is not present, so adopting it would mean bumping the whole Compose stack to an alpha BOM just for one component — rejected by the dependency rules (no alpha churn, master plan §10).

### Approach C — Third-party zoomable libraries

| Library | License | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `io.coil-kt.telephoto:zoomable` (Coil ecosystem) | Apache-2.0 | Mature API (Coil 2.x/3.x `zoomable()`), single-purpose, actively maintained — closest viable third-party option. |
| `com.github.SmartToolFactory` Compose zoomable suites | Apache-2.0 (per artifact) | Rich features but multi-artifact, API churn, mixed maintenance. |
| `PhotoView` (legacy View) via `AndroidView` | Apache-2.0 | View-world widget; defeats Compose recomposition, shared chrome, and unit-testable math. |

All rejected under AGENTS.md §3 / master plan §10: they add binary dependencies for a ~250-line gesture-state problem the stable Foundation pointer-input APIs fully cover, and they would fork our motion system onto someone else's springs.

### Approach D — Compose shared-element hero transition (`Modifier.sharedElement`)

True shared-element morph from grid tile to full screen. Rejected for the initial version: requires `@ExperimentalSharedTransitionApi` + `SharedTransitionScope` plumbing across `FlashMessageList` → `FlashMessageBubble` → tile → viewer, has documented edge cases with `LazyColumn` recycler bounds (keys recycled while open) and with zoomed/dismissed sibling states, and adds regression risk to already-accepted components (UI-005/UI-006/UI-017). The open/close feel is instead delivered by the existing `FlashMotion.mediaOpenEnter/Exit` scale+fade contract. Listed under Future improvements.

## What worked

- **Claim-policy gesture model** (Google Photos behavior): exactly one gesture family owns the pointer at any time; ownership is decided at touch-slop time by axis + zoom state. This eliminates every pager-vs-zoom-vs-dismiss conflict.
- **Pager counter pill** (WhatsApp): `3/7` position indicator is the most legible album affordance.
- **Chrome auto-hide on single tap** (Telegram): immersive inspection without permanent chrome.
- **Rubber-band springs** on over-zoom/over-pan release (universal in premium viewers) instead of hard clamps during the gesture.

## What did not work

- Two overlapping `detectTransformGestures` scopes (one per page + one for dismiss) — pointer ownership races when both stay attached unconditionally.
- Naive `scale + offset` math without anchor correction: double-tap would zoom from screen center instead of the tap point, and edge-pans would leave blank gaps (rejected in design; centered-anchor math specified instead).
- Blocking pager while loading: dismissing/hiding the viewer before decode completes must cancel the coroutine — `produceState` keyed to the URI handles this naturally.
- Full-resolution decode for every photo — OOM risk on albums; an `inSampleSize` guard (max ~4k on the long edge) is required.

## Chosen approach

Approach A: stable `HorizontalPager` + per-page custom `FlashZoomState` with an explicit claim policy, vertical drag-to-dismiss on the un-zoomed axis, tap-to-toggle chrome, counter + action chrome with Flash tokens, `mediaOpenEnter/Exit` open/close contract, `inSampleSize`-guarded decode. Zero new dependencies; UI-local models only.

## Why it was chosen

- Uses only APIs proven present in the project's resolved Compose version (verified from the 1.10.0 artifact — section "Research sources").
- All gesture math lives in pure Kotlin functions → unit-testable without instrumentation (Flash testing standard, cf. `FlashImageGridLogicTest`).
- No dependency additions (AGENTS.md §3, master plan §10).
- Reuses UI-037 motion tokens (`mediaOpenEnter/mediaOpenExit`, `springDefaultSpec`, `tweenNormalSpec`) — no ad-hoc timings.
- Keeps UI-005/017 untouched except threading `onImageClick`.
- ADR-005 applies: all visible styling through `FlashColors`/`FlashTypography` semantic tokens (two new semantic tokens added — section "Visual specification").

## Visual specification

All values reference tokens; raw values below are new **semantic tokens**, not scattered magic numbers.

### Backdrop
- New token `FlashColors.mediaViewerBackdrop` — near-black in **both themes**: light `#FF0A0C0E`, dark `#FF050607` (dark bullish, not pure black, matches ADR-005 graphite void). The viewer is deliberately always dark regardless of system theme (photo viewing readability; Telegram/WhatsApp behavior).
- Backdrop alpha during dismiss drag: `1f → 0f` mapped from dismiss progress (0 → 1).
- During dismiss, pages scale `1f → 0.94f` and translate with the finger.

### Chrome (top + bottom bars)
- Both bars: transparent backgrounds (no glassmorphism per ADR-005 avoid list) over the backdrop; text/icons white at 92% (`Color.White.copy(alpha = 0.92f)`) — constant over the dark backdrop.
- Top bar: `statusBarsPadding()`; leading close action = `FlashIcons.Close` (48dp touch target, `FlashDimensions.minTouchTarget`); center counter `FlashTypography.metadataEmphasis` `"3 / 7"`; trailing `FlashIcons.More` placeholder for future overflow actions.
- Bottom bar: `navigationBarsPadding()`; metadata row `FlashTypography.metadataDefault` → `senderName • timeLabel`; action row → `FlashIcons.Download` (export/save), `FlashIcons.Share` (**new Flash-owned icon**, section "Implementation notes"), `FlashIcons.Forward` (forward). 48dp targets each, spaced `FlashSpacing.space8`.
- New token `FlashColors.mediaViewerChromeText = Color.White` (92% applied at use).
- Counter active page uses `FlashColors.accentPrimary` for the current index part of the label only when dimmed state is off — kept white-92 in v1 for chrome cohesion; accent reserved for the focus ring on save success flash (UI-041 follow-up).

### Page
- Photo centered, `ContentScale.Fit` at scale 1.
- Behind the bitmap while loading: seed-gradient placeholder identical to `FlashImageTile` fallback (reuses `FlashImageAttachmentUi.seedColor`).
- Failure: `FlashIcons.Failed` tinted `FlashColors.mediaViewerChromeText`, caption `metadataDefault` "Couldn't load image", tap-retry via same gesture scope.

## Interaction specification

| Input | Un-zoomed (scale = 1) | Zoomed (scale > 1) |
|---|---|---|
| Single tap | Toggle chrome visibility | Toggle chrome visibility |
| Double tap | Zoom to `2.3×` anchored at tap point | Animate back to `1×` |
| Horizontal drag (1 finger) | `HorizontalPager` pages album | Pan image |
| Vertical drag (1 finger) | Dismiss drag (page tracks finger) | Pan image |
| Pinch (2 fingers) | Claim zoom (min 1×) | Zoom (clamp 1×–4×, +0.35 resistance overshoot) |
| Back gesture / button | Dismiss viewer | Dismiss viewer (after snap-reset zoom) |
| Release while zoomed & out of bounds | — | Rubber-band spring back to clamped bounds |

- Zoom state is **per page**; swiping pages springs the outgoing page back to `1×` so re-entry is always clean.
- Counter tracks `PagerState.currentPage` (snap updates after settle).
- Dismiss cancels cleanly from any state: Back → animate zoom reset if zoomed → overlay exit via `mediaOpenExit`.

## Animation specification

All specs via `FlashTheme.motion` (UI-037):

| Animation | Trigger | Target | Spec | Interruptible |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Viewer open | Image tile tap | Overlay enter | `motion.mediaOpenEnter()` (fade + 0.92→1 scale, `slowMillis`, Decelerate) | Yes |
| Viewer close (tap/back) | Back / close / <threshold release | Overlay exit | `motion.mediaOpenExit()` | Yes |
| Viewer close (drag) | Dismiss release over threshold | Offset exits with `motion.springDefaultSpec()`, backdrop fade `motion.tweenFastSpec()` | Yes |
| Double-tap zoom | Double tap | Scale 2.3× / 1×, offset re-centered | `motion.springDefaultSpec()` | Yes (tap_new restarts `Animatable`) |
| Pinch rubber-band | Release outside clamp | Scale/offset back to clamp | `motion.springDefaultSpec()` | Yes |
| Chrome toggle | Single tap | Bars slide ±`space16` + fade | `motion.statusCrossfade()` semantics (crossfade via `AnimatedVisibility` with `tweenNormalSpec` slide) | Yes |
| Page position snap | Swipe settle | `HorizontalPager` default pager physics | Pager default | — |
| Reduce-motion (`motion.reduceMotion`) | — | All tweens collapse to 0ms via existing tokens; pager snaps | — | — |

## Gesture specification

Single custom pointer-input per page using `awaitEachGesture`; claim policy constants (unit-tested):

```text
TOUCH_SLOP            = viewConfiguration.touchSlop          (~8dp device-dependent, read at runtime)
VERTICAL_CLAIM_FACTOR = 2.0f    // vertical displacement must exceed 2× touch slop AND |dy| > |dx| to claim dismiss
ZOOM_MIN              = 1.0f
ZOOM_MAX              = 4.0f
ZOOM_OVERSHOOT        = 0.35f   // pinch may temporarily exceed ZOOM_MAX by this fraction before spring-in
DOUBLE_TAP_SCALE      = 2.3f
DISMISS_DISTANCE      = 180.dp  // drag past this → dismiss
DISMISS_VELOCITY      = 900f dp/s → px   // fling past this → dismiss
```

Claim order per gesture event:
1. **Second pointer down** → pinch owns (consume all subsequent moves) until all pointers up.
2. **One pointer, zoomed** → pan owns; clamp check deferred to release (rubber-band).
3. **One pointer, un-zoomed, move first exceeds `VERTICAL_CLAIM_FACTOR × TOUCH_SLOP` with vertical dominance** → dismiss owns; horizontal component continues tracking pager-free (page follows finger X? no — only Y drives dismiss; X is ignored once claimed to avoid diagonal pager fights).
4. **One pointer, un-zoomed, horizontal dominance** → never consume; `HorizontalPager` receives it (child does not claim ⇒ pager handles).
5. **Tap/double-tap** handled by a separate lightweight `detectTapGestures` scope — taps never consume drags, so no conflict with the pager.

RTL: `HorizontalPager` respects layout direction natively; dismiss is vertical-only; no RTL-specific math.

## Accessibility requirements

- Every chrome action: `FlashDimensions.minTouchTarget` (48dp) + `contentDescription` from the `FlashIconSpec`.
- Pager semantics: Compose `HorizontalPager` provides page semantics; a `contentDescription` on each page of form `"Photo {n} of {total}"` — composed from the counter helper (unit-tested).
- TalkBack: single-tap chrome toggle remains; dismiss is reachable through the close button (never gesture-only).
- Reduce motion: all open/close/zoom animations collapse via `FlashMotion` token contract; pager snaps.
- No information conveyed by motion/color alone; failure state has text + icon.
- Large text: chrome metadata row uses `metadataDefault` and wraps; action row fixed-height, labels icon-only → no truncation risk.

## Responsive behavior

- Phone portrait/landscape: `fillMaxSize` page; chrome inset via system bars padding.
- Large phone / tablet / foldable: photo is `ContentScale.Fit` — no stretching; zoom clamp unchanged. No layout branches.
- Desktop window: same code path; min touch targets preserved.
- (Full window-size-chrome adaptation = UI-034 follow-up, tracked in responsive-layout.md.)

## Dark-mode behavior

Viewer is intentionally always-dark (photographic readability, peer-app consensus). Light and dark apps both get the near-black backdrop; chrome text is white-92 in both. This is a deliberate, documented departure from theme-switched surfaces — recorded as `mediaViewerBackdrop` with per-theme raw values rather than one constant, so UI-035 can still tune each theme later.

## Performance considerations

- **Decode**: `BitmapFactory` with `inSampleSize` computed to keep the long edge ≤ 4096px (pure function, unit-tested). Decode on `Dispatchers.IO` via `produceState` keyed by URI — cancelled automatically if the page leaves composition (pager recycling with `beyondViewportPageCount = 1`).
- **Recomposition**: zoom drives only `graphicsLayer` (GPU transform, zero layout); `FlashZoomState.animatables` read in a `graphicsLayer { }` scope.
- **Memory**: at most ~2 decoded bitmaps alive (current + 1 beyond-viewport each side cap by `beyondViewportPageCount = 1`); no manual bitmap cache in v1.
- **Animation cost**: springs on `Animatable` floats; no off-screen infinite transitions.

## Implementation notes

**Implementation status (2026-08-21):** Implemented in `ui/chat/src/main/java/com/transfer/flash/ui/chat/FlashMediaViewer.kt` (`FlashMediaViewer`, `FlashMediaPage`, `FlashZoomState`/`rememberFlashZoomState`, `FlashMediaViewerItem`, `FlashMediaViewerMath`). Tap path threaded `FlashImageGrid.onImageClick` → `FlashMessageBubble` → `FlashMessageList` → `FlashConversationScreen` (overlay via `AnimatedVisibility(motion.mediaOpenEnter/Exit)`, BackHandler, Toast placeholder actions). Unit tests: `FlashMediaViewerLogicTest.kt` (zoom clamp, pinch ceiling, anchored-offset invariant, pan limit, dismiss claim/distance/velocity, counter, page description, initial-page clamp, sample-size guard, backdrop/page dismiss mapping).

Implementation deviations from this spec (all minor):
- Double-tap zoom animates with `motion.springDefaultSpec()` as specified; pinch and pan use `Animatable.snapTo` routed through the external composition coroutine scope because `awaitEachGesture` is a restricted-suspension scope (documented pattern; ordering preserved by the main-immediate dispatcher).
- Dismiss drag distance lives in a plain `mutableStateOf(0f)` read only inside `drawBehind`/`graphicsLayer` scopes — zero recomposition during the drag.
- Page zoom reset triggers on `pagerState.settledPage` change (post-settle) rather than raw page change.

Target files:
- `ui/chat/src/main/java/com/transfer/flash/ui/chat/FlashMediaViewer.kt` (new): `FlashMediaViewer`, `FlashMediaPage`, `FlashZoomState` (`rememberFlashZoomState`), chrome bars, `FlashMediaViewerItem` UI model.
- `ui/chat/.../FlashMessageBubble.kt`: thread `onImageClick: (index: Int, image: FlashImageAttachmentUi) -> Unit` into `FlashImageGrid`.
- `ui/chat/.../FlashMessageList.kt`: thread `onImageClick: (FlashMessageUi, Int) -> Unit`.
- `ui/chat/.../FlashConversationScreen.kt`: hold `mediaViewerState` (album + initial index from tapped message), render overlay, wire Share/Save/Forward callbacks (v1: Toast placeholders — attachment pipeline not connected; see Known limitations).
- `ui/theme/src/main/java/.../FlashColors.kt`: add `mediaViewerBackdrop`, `mediaViewerChromeText` tokens (both palettes).
- `ui/theme/src/main/java/.../icons/FlashIcons.kt` + `ui/theme/src/main/res/drawable/flash_ic_share.xml`: **new Flash-owned share icon** (24×24, 2.0dp stroke, round caps/joins — matches the UI-002 redesign brief; the current set has no share glyph).
- `ui/chat/src/test/.../FlashMediaViewerLogicTest.kt` (new unit tests).

Dependencies: **none added**. Uses `androidx.compose.foundation:foundation` (already a `:ui:chat` dep).

Gesture note for device testing: `FlashImageTile` tiles use their own `detectTapGestures`, and the enclosing bubble uses `combinedClickable`. Compose child-before-parent pointer dispatch makes the tile consume its taps, but the smoke test must confirm the bubble context menu does **not** also open on tile tap; if it does, gate the parent click on an untile flag.

## Testing checklist

- [ ] Compose preview (viewer open with sample album)
- [ ] Physical device (Samsung SM_G986U1): open from grid tile, tap/long-press none, single-tap chrome toggle, double-tap zoom anchor, pinch 1×–4×, rubber-band, page swipe, dismiss drag + velocity fling, Back press, close button
- [ ] Dark mode (light app → dark viewer backdrop both directions)
- [ ] Large font / display size (chrome metadata row)
- [ ] RTL (pager direction)
- [ ] Reduced motion (open/close collapse, pager snaps)
- [ ] Unit tests green: zoom clamp math, dismiss distance/velocity, counter format, sample-size guard, initial-page clamp
- [ ] Performance spot-check: fling pager across 8-photo album — no dropped frames on device
- [ ] Build: `testDebugUnitTest assembleDebug`

## Known limitations

- **No video playback**: `FlashMediaAttachmentUi` is image-only in the current model; `FlashVideoViewer` is a separate future component (master plan allows phasing).
- **Per-message albums only**: the pager covers the tapped message's images, not a continuous whole-conversation media timeline (Telegram-style) — deferred.
- **No shared-element hero transition** (Approach D deferred — see above).
- **Share/Save/Forward are callbacks only** until the attachment/transfer pipeline lands; v1 shows Toast confirmation.
- **No zoom persistence** across viewer re-open (acceptable: viewers universally reset).
- **Download-to-gallery (MediaStore write)** not implemented; "Save/Export" is a placeholder action in v1.

## Future improvements

- `FlashVideoViewer` page (UI-018.5) driven by a `FlashVideoAttachmentUi` model + `Media3 ExoPlayer` (dependency ADR required).
- Compose shared-element hero transition from tile → viewer (after `SharedTransitionScope` stabilizes / or alpha decision documented).
- Whole-conversation media pager with virtualized list across messages.
- Double-tap-and-hold interim zoom (Google Photos behavior).
- Save to device gallery via MediaStore `CreateWriteRequest` + confirmation micro-interaction (UI-041).
- Zoom affordance: subtle scale-overshoot on first open hint for never-opened photos (measure with UI-042).

## What makes this Flash?

The viewer uses Flash's own visual language end-to-end: Flash-owned 2.0dp-stroke iconography in chrome (including a new share glyph drawn for this component — no Material icons), `FlashTypography` metadata voice for sender/time, the Flash Pulse accent reserved for state flashes rather than decoration, graphite-void dark backdrop tuned per-theme in the `FlashColors` token system rather than hardcoded black, and UI-037 motion tokens (`mediaOpenEnter/Exit` reserved tokens finally realized, `springDefaultSpec` rubber-bands) — so open/close/zoom feel identical to the rest of Flash. The gesture claim policy (vertical-drag dismiss ↔ horizontal pager ↔ pinch zoom, one owner at a time) is interaction design, not styling — no app is cloned; the chromat of pull-to-dismiss + scale + fade is Flash's own composition of the same primitives the app already uses everywhere else.
