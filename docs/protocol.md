# Flash Transfer Protocol

## Version
Protocol version: `1`

## Current LAN Session

The initial LAN milestone does not yet transfer files. It implements a persistent TCP session after NSD discovery so two devices can verify that the advertised address and port are connectable and keep that connection alive.

The probe server prefers TCP port `45821`. If that port is unavailable on the device, it falls back to a dynamic port and advertises the selected port through NSD. The stable preferred port reduces failures from stale mDNS/NSD cache entries pointing at an old random port.

### Client hello

```text
FLASH_HELLO version=1 deviceId=<escaped-device-id> name=<escaped-friendly-name>
```

### Server response

```text
FLASH_OK version=1 deviceId=<escaped-device-id> name=<escaped-friendly-name>
```

### Disconnect notification

```text
FLASH_DISCONNECT version=1 deviceId=<escaped-device-id> name=<escaped-friendly-name>
```

### Heartbeat

```text
FLASH_PING version=1 deviceId=<escaped-device-id> name=<escaped-friendly-name>
FLASH_PONG version=1 deviceId=<escaped-device-id> name=<escaped-friendly-name>
```

After a successful `FLASH_HELLO` / `FLASH_OK` exchange, both phones keep the TCP socket open. Each side sends periodic `FLASH_PING` messages and responds to received pings with `FLASH_PONG`. `FLASH_DISCONNECT` closes the live session and clears connected state on the peer.

### Escaping
- `%` becomes `%25`
- space becomes `%20`
- `=` becomes `%3D`

## Experimental WebSocket Transfer Track (side track — not the main protocol)

Added 2026-08-20 at owner request (see ADR-007). Independent of the session above; uses minimal RFC 6455 WebSocket framing over TCP, cleartext `ws://` on trusted LAN only.

- Every device runs a WebSocket server (preferred port `45822`, dynamic fallback) and can open any number of client connections, so 3+ devices can fully mesh.
- Upgrade handshake: standard RFC 6455 (`GET /flash-ws`, `Sec-WebSocket-Key` / `Sec-WebSocket-Accept`, version 13); client frames are masked, server frames are not.
- Pairing: both sides send a text frame immediately after upgrade:

```text
FLASH_WS_HELLO version=1 deviceId=<escaped-device-id> name=<escaped-friendly-name>
```

- Peers are keyed by `deviceId`; if a pair holds one connection per direction, the outbound one is primary and the inbound one is fallback.
- File transfer (one active transfer per connection; messages are ordered):

```text
FLASH_FILE_START version=1 transferId=<id> name=<escaped-file-name> size=<bytes-or--1>
<binary frames: raw file bytes, 64 KiB each, in order>
FLASH_FILE_END version=1 transferId=<id> bytes=<bytes-sent>
FLASH_FILE_ACK version=1 transferId=<id> received=<bytes-received> ok=<true|false>
```

- Receiver saves to `filesDir/ws-received/` (deduplicated names) and verifies the byte count before `ok=true`.
- Escaping matches the session protocol (`%25`, `%20`, `%3D`).
- Known limits: no TLS, no trust/verification UX, no resume, no hash verification, no app-level heartbeat (relies on TCP failure surfacing).

## Intended Full Protocol

The production transfer protocol will run over TLS and will include:

- `HELLO`
- `HELLO_ACK`
- `PAIR_REQUEST`
- `PAIR_ACCEPT`
- `TRANSFER_REQUEST`
- `TRANSFER_ACCEPT`
- `FILE_START`
- `CHUNK`
- `CHUNK_ACK`
- `FILE_COMPLETE`
- `TRANSFER_COMPLETE`
- `ERROR`
- `CANCEL`
- `DISCONNECT`
- `PAUSE`
- `RESUME`

The wire protocol must stay transport-independent so LAN and Wi-Fi Direct can use the same transfer engine.
