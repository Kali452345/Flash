/**
 * Pure merge logic for the one-time migration of legacy SharedPreferences-backed
 * trust entries into the Room pin store (C2.4).
 *
 * Legacy rows (`AndroidPreferencesTrustStore`, keys `paired_<deviceId>` → name)
 * carry NO cryptographic fingerprint. They are imported as history with
 * [TofuPolicy.LEGACY_UNBOUND_FINGERPRINT] so:
 * - they still appear in `trustedPeers()` / UI device lists, but
 * - [TofuPolicy] treats them as unpinned and prompts again on next contact — a
 *   legacy "trust flag bound to nothing" must never silently become a crypto pin.
 *
 * Idempotency rule: any device already present in Room (with or without pin) wins;
 * the legacy entry is skipped. Pure function — unit-testable without Android/Room.
