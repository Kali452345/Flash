/**
 * Pure, single-threaded completion state machine for multi-stream transfers (ERROR-013 fix).
 *
 * Owns the ENTIRE completion semantics that v1 entangled with its worker loop:
 *
 * ```
 * COLLECTING ──coverage──> AWAITING_RECEIVER_COMPLETE ──receiver COMPLETE──> RESOLVED(verified)
 *     │                          │                                              ^  |
 *     │                          + grace expired (watcher) ─────────────────────>┘  | late COMPLETE
 *     ├─ receiver COMPLETE early ──────────────────────────────────────────────────>┘  (upgrade)
 *     │
 *     └─ all channels dead, coverage NOT full ──> RESOLVED(Failed)
 * ```
 *
 * ## The contract that killed v1 (racing-ACK vs exactly-once COMPLETE)
 *
 * - Local ACK coverage reaching [totalChunks] does **not** immediately resolve when the
 *   receiver's authoritative COMPLETE frame has not arrived yet: it enters
 *   [Phase.AWAITING_RECEIVER_COMPLETE] and starts a grace window. This preserves the receiver's
 *   `verified` flag for the UI (E2E asserts it).
 * - The receiver COMPLETE frame resolves from ANY phase — including *after* an
 *   ACK-coverage resolution — and **upgrades** the recorded `verified` value (late-authoritative-
 *   frame upgrade). This is what the racing-ACK contract requires.
 * - If [graceMs] is 0, coverage resolves immediately with `verified = receiverVerified ?: null`
 *   (callers without a receiver pass 0; the racing-ACK test uses this).
 * - Exactly-once COMPLETE emission: the emission callback fires at most once per machine,
 *   on the FIRST resolution that needs a coordination frame.
 * - Resolution is absorbing; every event on a resolved machine returns [Outcome.None].
 *
 * Thread-safety: internally synchronized (like [MultiStreamReceiver]); cheap critical sections
 * only, so callers may hold it across their own bookkeeping via returned outcomes.
 *
 * Determinism: time enters ONLY through explicit [nowMs] reads compared against injected
 * [graceMs]; tests either inject a fake clock or use graceMs = 0 for immediate transitions.
