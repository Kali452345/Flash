import java.util.BitSet

/**
 * Persistent per-transfer record of which chunk indexes have been received (and hash-verified),
 * the resume state primitive for C5.6.
 *
 * ## Merge rule (`reconcile`) — monotonic union
 *
 * [reconcile] performs a **union**: an index is "done" if either side reported it done. This is
 * the correct merge for every consumer of this class:
 *
 * - **Receiver-side view:** progress only grows — a chunk once verified on disk can never become
 *   un-verified, so union with any later report cannot regress state.
 * - **Sender-side mirror of receiver progress (ACK reconciliation):** `ACK_BATCH.indexes` are
 *   authoritative facts emitted by the receiver after hash verification; unioning them into the
 *   sender's confirmed-set mirrors how BitTorrent peers merge handshake `bitfield` + incremental
 *   `have` announcements, which are likewise monotonic grow-only sets
 *   (https://github.com/mgp/coding-in-the-real-world/blob/master/manuscript/bittorrent-client-case-study.md;
 *   https://atomashpolskiy.github.io/bt/javadoc/latest/bt/data/Bitfield.html).
 * - **Reconcile-on-reconnect (C5.6):** the sender asks the receiver for its done-set and unions
 *   it with the locally persisted mirror before resuming at the first hole.
 *
 * ## Serialization format (compact bit-vector)
 *
 * Backed by [BitSet] packed via [BitSet.toLongArray]: `int32 LE wordCount` followed by
 * `wordCount` × 8 bytes, each 64-bit word written little-endian. Bit `n` of the vector lives in
 * word `n / 64`, bit value `1L shl (n % 64)`. [fromSerialized] rejects words beyond the expected
 * count and ignores/clears padding bits at or above [totalChunks], so a hostile or stale payload
 * can never resurrect chunks that do not belong to the transfer.
