/**
 * Receive-side counterpart of [MultiStreamDispatcher] (C5.7): accepts frames arriving over ANY of
 * the N parallel channels and feeds them into ONE [ReceivePipeline], then routes emitted feedback
 * frames back down the channel whose bytes triggered them.
 *
 * ## Why ONE pipeline for N channels
 *
 * Chunk arrival order across sockets is arbitrary; ordering is delegated to the pipeline's
 * duplicate-tolerant, out-of-order-tolerant semantics (`ResumeBitVector` marks by index,
 * `ChunkSink.write(index, ...)` scatters to slot positions — no sequencing needed). A per-channel
 * pipeline would fragment ACK state and break exactly-once bookkeeping.
 *
 * ## Why ACK_BATCH replies travel down the ARRIVING channel
 *
 * 1. **Liveness symmetry** — the socket that just delivered a chunk is provably open in both
 *    directions right now (TCP-level reachability was just demonstrated); replying on it never
 *    needs a reverse connection.
 * 2. **Per-path congestion honesty** — pairing each ACK with its own path lets the sender's
 *    failure isolation attribute loss/latency to the exact stream instead of smearing it across
 *    all N (same reason MPSCP assigns results to their serving stream:
 *    https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1143126).
 * 3. **No routing table needed** — the sender's dispatcher accepts ACK batches on ANY channel
 *    (`MultiStreamDispatcher.onInboundFrame`), so arrival-channel reply is always correct even if
 *    another channel died a moment earlier.
 * COMPLETE is likewise routed down the arriving channel: it is emitted atomically with the final
 * partial ACK under this class's single lock, so both land on one provably-live path.
 *
 * ## Exactly-once COMPLETE across concurrent channels
 *
 * All pipeline access is serialized through one monitor, so even when the last chunks race in on
 * different channels, `ReceivePipeline`'s session-finished guard produces the COMPLETE frame
 * exactly once, attributed to whichever single delivery won the lock ("last-finishing coordinator
 * path").
